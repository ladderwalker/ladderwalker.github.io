I"R<p>Ladderwalker’s android apps are known great classics,
however the evil big tech giant known as Google, censored
some of these great classics mainly from a place of what
appeared to be pure jealousy*.</p>

<p>Just as David bested Goliath with a fatal stone throw to
the temple, I too will put Google to death for messing
with StairCalc and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=ladderwalker&amp;c=apps">likes</a></p>

<p>Ladderwalker is a hardcore carpenter by day and does
any dev work in whatever spare time he has, which is none
because he’s busy raising his 2 kids.</p>
